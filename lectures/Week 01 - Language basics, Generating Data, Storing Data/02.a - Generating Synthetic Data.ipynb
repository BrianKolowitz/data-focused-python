    "# Generating Synthetic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the hardest things to do in data science is get access to high quality datasets that relate to your specific questions. There's any number of reasons why researchers and analysts get incorrect results and misread the answers they're getting. [Bad data practice](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2018/02/19/how-bad-data-practice-is-leading-to-bad-research/#5e7cfbad1c35) may be leading to bad research. Some bad data practice themes might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Honest Statistical/Computing Error\n",
    "* Honest Misunderstanding of Data\n",
    "* Honest Misapplication of Methods\n",
    "* Honest Failure to Normalize and Malicious Manipulation\n",
    "* (made worse through the) Poor citation practices of Copy-Paste Google Scholar-ship.\n",

    "In this class we're going to learn how to process and analyze data using python. Since I work in healthcare we'll be using a tool called [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Getting-Started) which will help us create consistent meaningful datasets at scale in a vareity of formats (Text, CSV, C-CDA, and FHIR). We'll use these datasets to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn about basic and advanced python concepts\n",
    "* Learn about handling data in python\n",
    "* Answer simple and complex questions about the data\n",
    "* Generate interesting visualizations\n"

    "> SyntheaTM is a synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Our mission is to output high-quality synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering every aspect of healthcare. The resulting data is free from cost, privacy, and security restrictions. It can be used without restriction for a variety of secondary uses in academia, research, industry, and government (although a citation would be appreciated).\n",
    "\n",
    "> SyntheaTM generates synthetic patient records using an agent-based approach. Each synthetic patient is generated independently, as they progress from birth to death through modular representations of various diseases and conditions. Each patient runs through every module in the system. Once a patient dies or the simulation reaches the current day, that patient record can be exported in a number of different formats.\n",

    "Text format is a quick human readable format. This format doesn't adhere to any particular standard. Text formats are most commonly consumed by humans who may be clinicians or other application end users. The other data formats (CSV, C-CDA, and FHIR) can be easily converted to a Text format. However, converting a Text format to any of the other data formats is extremely challenging. Often times we use Natuarl Language Processing (NLP) and Regular Expressions (RegEx) as we attempt the Text to (CSV, C-CDA, FHIR) conversion.\n",
