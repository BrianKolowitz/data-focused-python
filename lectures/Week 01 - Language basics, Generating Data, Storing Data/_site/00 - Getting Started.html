<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<p>Welcome to Data Focused Python. In this guide we’ll walk through all the steps you need to get started with the course. Python has a robust community which is great, but it also means there’s going to be many options from python distribution to IDEs to libraries. There’s no right or wrong selection, only the one that works best for you.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Python 3.9</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="development-environment">Development Environment</h2>

<p>You can use any combination of technology that you’re most familiar with. However, I do recommend one of two setups:</p>

<h3 id="recommended-configuration">Recommended Configuration</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Python - <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda Python</a></li>
  <li>IDE - <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html">Creating Conda Virtual Environments in Pycharm</a></p>

<h3 id="my-configuration">My Configuration</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Python - <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a></li>
  <li>Visual Studio Code - <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">vscode</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="your-first-python-program">Your First Python Program</h2>

<p>Now that you have everything setup, you’ll want to dive in and create your first program. Jetbrains has a great tutorial that describes how to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-running-your-first-python-project.html#Creating_and_Running_Your_First_language_Project.xml">Create and Running Your First Python Project</a>. Once you’re comfortable creating programs you might want to learn how to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/debugging-your-first-python-application.html#Debugging_Your_First_Python_Application.xml">Debug Your First Python Application</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/testing-your-first-python-application.html#Testing_Your_First__language__Application.xml">Test Your First Python Application</a>, or even <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-running-your-first-django-project.html">Creating and Running Your First Django Project</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> is a great way to build web applications in python, but debugging, testing, and creating web applications are not required components of this course. However, these are useful skills to pick up as you become more familiar with building solutions in python.</p>

<h2 id="cloning-the-course-materials">Cloning the Course Materials</h2>

<p>After you’re comfortable working with your Python IDE to create basic python programs, you’ll want to clone the course materials from <a href="https://github.com/BrianKolowitz/data-focused-python">GitHub</a>. Before you can clone the repository, you’ll have to install <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> on your local machine. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> is a distributed version control system that’s great for managing projects with distributed team members. There’s a lot of great resources on how to use git. Here’s 2 of my favorite interactive tutorials:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">Try Git</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">Learn Git Branching</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We won’t be doing any branching in this course, but I think it’s important to know so I’ve included the link.</p>

<p>Once you’ve installed git and are somewhat comfortable with the command line tool, you can read about how to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository">Clone a Repository</a> from GitHub.</p>

<p>It’s as easy as:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/BrianKolowitz/data-focused-python.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, I personally like to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">Add SSH Keys to GitHub</a> and clone using this command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone git@github.com:BrianKolowitz/data-focused-python.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="running-the-notebooks">Running the Notebooks</h2>

<p>Once the course git repository has been cloned locally you can run the course notebooks and follow along in class or try them at home.</p>

<p>First, change the directory to the data-focused-python directory of your clonned repository,.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>data-focused-python
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then start Jupyter from your terminal</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jupyter-lab
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. If you’ve installed <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/index.html">Jupyter</a> is packaged as part of the distribution.</p>

<h2 id="running-the-python-interpreter">Running the Python Interpreter</h2>

<p>Python itself is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language">interpreted programming language</a> which means the source code you type gets executed by the interpreter at runtime. You can start the python interpreter from any command line by executing the following in your terminal:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I encourage you to try it out. You can follow along the official python docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/interpreter.html">here</a></p>

<h2 id="running-the-ipython-interpreter">Running the IPython Interpreter</h2>

<p><a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> builds on the Python interpreter adding advanced read-eval-print-loop (REPL) functionality <a href="https://plot.ly/python/ipython-vs-python/#targetText=IPython%20is%20an%20interactive%20command%2Dline%20terminal%20for%20Python.&amp;targetText=IPython%20offers%20an%20enhanced%20read,certainly%20not%20the%20only%20one">among other features</a>.</p>

<p>You can start the ipython interpreter by executing the following command in your terminal:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ipython
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="executing-python-files">Executing Python Files</h2>

<p>Using the Python interpreter is great for small problems, testing libraries, etc. but all of your code lives in memory inside the python interpreter. When the interpreter stops your code is gone forever. In order to get around this limitation you can create python script files and execute the files using the interpreter.</p>

<p>Create a file on your harddrive called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello.py</code>. Copy and paste this code into the file and save it.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'Hello class'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'Welcome to 95-888'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can then execute the file by typing this command into your terminal.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python hello.py
</code></pre></div></div>
