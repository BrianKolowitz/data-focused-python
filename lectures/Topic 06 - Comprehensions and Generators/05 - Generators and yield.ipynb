However, unlike lists, lazy iterators do not store their contents in memory. For an overview of iterators in Python, take a look at Python “for” Loops (Definite Iteration).\n",

More importantly, it allows you to `.send()` a value back to the generator. When execution picks up after yield, `i` will take the value that is sent."
