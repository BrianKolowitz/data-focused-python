    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping, often called web crawling or web spidering, or “programmatically going over a collection of web pages and extracting data,” is a powerful tool for working with data on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a web scraper, you can mine data about a set of products, get a large corpus of text or quantitative data to play around with, get data from a site without an official API, or just satisfy your own personal curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you’ll learn about the fundamentals of the scraping and spidering process as you explore a playful data set. We’ll use BrickSet, a community-run site that contains information about LEGO sets. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a fully functional Python web scraper that walks through a series of pages on Brickset and extracts data about LEGO sets from each page, displaying the data to your screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scraper will be easily expandable so you can tinker around with it and use it as a foundation for your own projects scraping data from the web."

    "## Step 1 — Creating a Basic Scraper\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping is a two step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You systematically find and download web pages.\n",
    "2. You take those web pages and extract information from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of those steps can be implemented in a number of ways in many languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build a scraper from scratch using modules or libraries provided by your programming language, but then you have to deal with some potential headaches as your scraper grows more complex. For example, you’ll need to handle concurrency so you can crawl more than one page at a time. You’ll probably want to figure out how to transform your scraped data into different formats like ```CSV```, ```XML```, or ```JSON```. And you’ll sometimes have to deal with sites that require specific settings and access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll have better luck if you build your scraper on top of an existing library that handles those issues for you. For this tutorial, we’re going to use Python and [Scrapy](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.1/intro/overview.html) to build our scraper."

It makes scraping a quick and fun process!\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrapy, like most Python packages, is on PyPI (also known as ```pip```). PyPI, the Python Package Index, is a community-owned repository of all published Python software.\n",

    "2. Next, we take the ```Spider``` class provided by Scrapy and make a subclass out of it called ```BrickSetSpider```. Think of a subclass as a more specialized form of its parent class. The ```Spider``` subclass has methods and behaviors that define how to follow URLs and extract data from the pages it finds, but it doesn’t know where to look or what data to look for. By subclassing it, we can give it that information.\n",
    "3. Then we give the spider the name ```brickset_spider```.\n",
    "4. Finally, we give our scraper a single URL to start from: http://brickset.com/sets/year-2016. If you open that URL in your browser, it will take you to a search results page, showing the first of many pages containing LEGO sets."

    "In this tutorial you built a fully-functional spider that extracts data from web pages in less than thirty lines of code. That’s a great start, but there’s a lot of fun things you can do with this spider. Here are some ways you could expand the code you’ve written. They’ll give you some practice scraping data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Right now we’re only parsing results from 2016, as you might have guessed from the ```2016``` part of http://brickset.com/sets/year-2016 — how would you crawl results from other years?\n",
    "2. There’s a retail price included on most sets. How do you extract the data from that cell? How would you get a raw number out of it? *Hint: you’ll find the data in a ```dt``` just like the number of pieces and minifigs.*\n",
    "3. Most of the results have tags that specify semantic data about the sets or their context. How do we crawl these, given that there are multiple tags for a single set?"
