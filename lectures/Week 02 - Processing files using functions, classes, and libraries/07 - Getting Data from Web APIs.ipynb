    "# Python API tutorial - An Introduction to using APIs\n",
    "[source](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Application Program Interfaces, or APIs, are commonly used to retrieve data from remote websites. Sites like Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook all offer certain data through their APIs. To use an API, you make a request to a remote web server, and retrieve the data you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why use an API instead of a static dataset you can download? APIs are useful in the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data is changing quickly. An example of this is stock price data. It doesn't really make sense to regenerate a dataset and download it every minute -- this will take a lot of bandwidth, and be pretty slow.\n",
    "* You want a small piece of a much larger set of data. Reddit comments are one example. What if you want to just pull your own comments on Reddit? It doesn't make much sense to download the entire Reddit database, then filter just your own comments.\n",
    "* There is repeated computation involved. Spotify has an API that can tell you the genre of a piece of music. You could theoretically create your own classifier, and use it to categorize music, but you'll never have as much data as Spotify does.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases like the ones above, an API is the right solution. In this blog post, we'll be querying a simple API to retrieve data about the International Space Station (ISS). Using an API will save us time and effort over doing all the computation ourselves.\n",

    "\n",
    "APIs are hosted on web servers. When you type www.google.com in your browser's address bar, your computer is actually asking the www.google.com server for a webpage, which it then returns to your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs work much the same way, except instead of your web browser asking for a webpage, your program asks for data. This data is usually returned in JSON format (for more on this, checkout our tutorial on working with JSON data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the data, we make a request to a webserver. The server then replies with our data. In Python, we'll use the [requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library to do this. In this Python API tutorial we'll be using Python 3.4 for all of our examples."

    "## Type of requests\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of requests. The most commonly used one, a GET request, is used to retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a simple GET request to retrieve information from the OpenNotify API.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenNotify has several API endpoints. An endpoint is a server route that is used to retrieve different data from the API. For example, the ```/comments``` endpoint on the Reddit API might retrieve information about comments, whereas the ```/users``` endpoint might retrieve data about users. To access them, you would add the endpoint to the base url of the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first endpoint we'll look at on OpenNotify is the ```iss-now.json``` endpoint. This endpoint gets the current latitude and longitude of the International Space Station. As you can see, retrieving this data isn't a great fit for a dataset, because it involves some calculation on the server, and changes quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see a listing of all the endpoints on OpenNotify [here](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *base url* for the OpenNotify API is ```http://api.open-notify.org```, so we'll add this to the beginning of all of our endpoints."
