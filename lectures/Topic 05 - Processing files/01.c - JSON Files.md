## Python Serialization

In this instance, serialization is the process of converting the python objects to JSON. Python object types get serialized to the following JSON types.

Python | JSON
--- | ---
dict | object
list, tuple | array
str	| string
int, long, float | number
True | true
False | false
None | null


```python
import json
pprint(games)
print()

games_json = json.dumps(games)
pprint(games_json)
```

    {'games': [{'away_score': 10,
                'away_team': 'Cubs',
                'date': '2019-05-01',
                'home_score': 0,
                'home_team': 'Pirates'},
               {'away_score': 0,

## Writing JSON files


```python
with open("games.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(games, f)
```

## Reading JSON files


```python
# open and print line by line
with open('games.json', "r") as f:
    games = json.load(f)
    print(games)
```

    {'games': [{'date': '2019-05-01', 'home_team': 'Pirates', 'home_score': 0, 'away_team': 'Cubs', 'away_score': 10}, {'date': '2019-05-15', 'home_team': 'Reds', 'home_score': 7, 'away_team': 'Pirates', 'away_score': 0}, {'date': '2019-05-17', 'home_team': 'Reds', 'home_score': 12, 'away_team': 'Pirates', 'away_score': 0}, {'date': '2019-05-18', 'home_team': 'Reds', 'home_score': 8, 'away_team': 'Pirates', 'away_score': 0}, {'date': '2019-05-21', 'home_team': 'Pirates', 'home_score': 1, 'away_team': 'Brewers', 'away_score': 11}]}


# Using JSONPath

[Source](https://restfulapi.net/json-jsonpath/)

One of the biggest strengths of XML is XPath, the query-oriented language to query subsections of an XML document. In the same line, JSONPath is a query language with features similar to XPath that lets you extract just the bits of a JSON document your application needs.


## JSONPath Syntax

As XPath, JSONPath also has syntax to follow:
* ```$``` – symbol refers to the root object or element.
* ```@``` – symbol refers to the current object or element.
* ```.``` – operator is the dot-child operator, which you use to denote a child element of the current element.
* ```[ ]``` – is the subscript operator, which you use to denote a child element of the current element (by name or index).
* ```*``` – operator is a wildcard, returning all objects or elements regardless of their names.
* ```,``` – operator is the union operator, which returns the union of the children or indexes indicated.
* ```:``` – operator is the array slice operator, so you can slice collections using the syntax [start:end:step] to return a subcollection of a collection.
* ```( )``` – operator lets you pass a script expression in the underlying implementation’s script language. It’s not supported by every implementation of JSONPath, however.
* ```?``` ( ) – to query all items that meet a certain criteria.

There are many online jsonpath validators out there, and I encourage you to try a few.

## Using JSONPath in Python

To use JSONPath, you will need to include its dependency and then use it.

The library we'll use is [jsonpath-rw-ext](https://pypi.org/project/jsonpath-rw-ext/)

```python
pip install jsonpath-rw-ext
```

Once installed we're ready to use it.

## Finding Information about Pirate Games

Lets try to parse a JSON file a few different ways. First, we need to load the data as a JSON object into memory.


```python
with open('games.json', "r") as f:
    games = json.load(f)
    pprint(games)
```

    {'games': [{'away_score': 10,
                'away_team': 'Cubs',
                'date': '2019-05-01',
                'home_score': 0,
                'home_team': 'Pirates'},
               {'away_score': 0,
                'away_team': 'Pirates',
                'date': '2019-05-15',
                'home_score': 7,
                'home_team': 'Reds'},
               {'away_score': 0,
                'away_team': 'Pirates',
                'date': '2019-05-17',
                'home_score': 12,
                'home_team': 'Reds'},
               {'away_score': 0,
                'away_team': 'Pirates',
                'date': '2019-05-18',
                'home_score': 8,
                'home_team': 'Reds'},
               {'away_score': 11,
                'away_team': 'Brewers',
                'date': '2019-05-21',
                'home_score': 1,
                'home_team': 'Pirates'}]}


Now that the data is loaded, we can try to answer a few questions.

### What dates were the games played on?


```python
# json parsing
game_dates = []
for game in games['games']:
    game_date = game['date']
    game_dates.append(game_date)
print(game_dates)
```

    ['2019-05-01', '2019-05-15', '2019-05-17', '2019-05-18', '2019-05-21']



```python
# jsonpath parsing
# import the library
import jsonpath_rw_ext as jp
```


```python
# create a jsonpath expression and match
game_dates = jp.match("$.games[*].date", games)
print(game_dates)
```

    ['2019-05-01', '2019-05-15', '2019-05-17', '2019-05-18', '2019-05-21']



```python
# this also works
game_dates = jp.match("$.games..date", games)
print(game_dates)
```

    ['2019-05-01', '2019-05-15', '2019-05-17', '2019-05-18', '2019-05-21']


### What were the scores for the Pirates home games?


```python
# json parsing
home_scores = []
for game in games['games']:
    if game['home_team'] == 'Pirates':
        home_scores.append(game)
        
pprint(home_scores)
```

    [{'away_score': 10,
      'away_team': 'Cubs',
      'date': '2019-05-01',
      'home_score': 0,
      'home_team': 'Pirates'},
     {'away_score': 11,
      'away_team': 'Brewers',
      'date': '2019-05-21',
      'home_score': 1,
      'home_team': 'Pirates'}]



```python
# jsonpath parsing
home_scores = jp.match("$.games[?(@.home_team=='Pirates')]", games)
pprint(home_scores)
```

    [{'away_score': 10,
      'away_team': 'Cubs',
      'date': '2019-05-01',
      'home_score': 0,
      'home_team': 'Pirates'},
     {'away_score': 11,
      'away_team': 'Brewers',
      'date': '2019-05-21',
      'home_score': 1,
      'home_team': 'Pirates'}]


### What were the scores after May 15th


```python
# json parsing
game_scores = []
for game in games['games']:
    if game['date'] > '2019-05-15':
        game_scores.append(game)
        
pprint(game_scores)
```

    [{'away_score': 0,
      'away_team': 'Pirates',
      'date': '2019-05-17',
      'home_score': 12,
      'home_team': 'Reds'},
     {'away_score': 0,
      'away_team': 'Pirates',
      'date': '2019-05-18',
      'home_score': 8,
      'home_team': 'Reds'},
     {'away_score': 11,
      'away_team': 'Brewers',
      'date': '2019-05-21',
      'home_score': 1,
      'home_team': 'Pirates'}]



```python
# jsonpath parsing
game_scores = jp.match("$.games[?(@.date > '2019-05-15')]", games)
pprint(game_scores)
```

    [{'away_score': 0,
      'away_team': 'Pirates',
      'date': '2019-05-17',
      'home_score': 12,
      'home_team': 'Reds'},
     {'away_score': 0,
      'away_team': 'Pirates',
      'date': '2019-05-18',
      'home_score': 8,
      'home_team': 'Reds'},
     {'away_score': 11,
      'away_team': 'Brewers',
      'date': '2019-05-21',
      'home_score': 1,
      'home_team': 'Pirates'}]



```python

```
