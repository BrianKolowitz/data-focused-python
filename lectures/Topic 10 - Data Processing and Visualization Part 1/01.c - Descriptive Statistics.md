# Descriptive Statistics

* Min
* Max
* Mean
* Median
* Standard Deviation
* Variance

First we're going to define a method to get the patient's age from their birthdate and then use that function to create a list of patient ages.


```python
import csv

from datetime import date, timedelta
from dateutil import parser

def get_age(birth_date):
    if isinstance(birth_date, str):
        birth_date = parser.parse(birth_date).date()

    age = (date.today() - birth_date) // timedelta(days=365)
    return age
```


```python
# calculate a list of patient ages
patient_ages = []
with open('../data/csv/patients.csv') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for i, row in enumerate(reader):
        date_of_birth = row['BIRTHDATE']
        age = get_age(date_of_birth)
        patient_ages.append(age)
print(patient_ages)
```

    [6, 18, 13, 17, 8, 9, 55, 84, 14, 20, 53, 23, 18, 64, 11, 39, 34, 5, 82, 19, 18, 15, 26, 28, 29, 8, 71, 32, 82, 41, 51, 17, 40, 53, 60, 65, 11, 21, 32, 52, 3, 52, 82, 30, 69, 24, 99, 12, 51, 99, 27, 76, 78, 29, 16, 69, 34, 78, 58, 76, 99, 65, 70, 60, 50, 32, 4, 78, 65, 48, 3, 66, 77, 99, 25, 18, 47, 79, 99, 32, 10, 74, 61, 99, 62, 59, 67, 2, 50, 99, 3, 70, 61, 62, 43, 18, 71, 29, 99, 52, 71, 26, 28, 56, 32, 69, 23, 31, 46, 99, 106, 30, 21, 67, 67, 106, 99, 106, 99, 106, 106, 99, 106, 99, 99, 99, 99, 90, 90]


## Min & Max


```python
# find min and max with a for loop:
min_age = 0
max_age = 0

for i, age in enumerate(patient_ages):
    if i == 0:
        min_age = age
        max_age = age
        
    if age < min_age:
        min_age = age
    if age > max_age:
        max_age = age

print(f'Min Age: {min_age}, Max Age: {max_age}')
```

    Min Age: 2, Max Age: 106



```python
# find min and max with a for loop:
min_age = patient_ages[0]
max_age = patient_ages[0]

for age in patient_ages:
    if age < min_age:
        min_age = age
    if age > max_age:
        max_age = age

print(f'Min Age: {min_age}, Max Age: {max_age}')
```

    Min Age: 2, Max Age: 106



```python
# find min and max by sorting
sorted_ages = sorted(patient_ages)
min_age = sorted_ages[0]
max_age = sorted_ages[-1]
print(f'Min Age: {min_age}, Max Age: {max_age}')
```

    Min Age: 2, Max Age: 106



```python
# find min and max with reduce
from functools import reduce

min_age = reduce(lambda a, b : a if a < b else b, patient_ages)
max_age = reduce(lambda a, b : a if a > b else b, patient_ages)
print(f'Min Age: {min_age}, Max Age: {max_age}')
```

    Min Age: 2, Max Age: 106



```python
# find min and max with min and max
min_age = min(patient_ages)
max_age = max(patient_ages)
print(f'Min Age: {min_age}, Max Age: {max_age}')
```

    Min Age: 2, Max Age: 106


## Mean


```python
# calculate mean with a for loop
total_age = 0
age_count = 0

for age in patient_ages:
    total_age += age
    age_count += 1
    
mean_age = total_age / age_count
print(f'Mean Age: {mean_age}')
```

    Mean Age: 52.62015503875969



```python
# calculate mean age with reduce 
import functools
total_age = functools.reduce(lambda a, b : a + b, patient_ages)
age_count = len(patient_ages)

mean_age = total_age / age_count
print(f'Mean Age: {mean_age}')
```

    Mean Age: 52.62015503875969



```python
# calculate mean age with sum and len
mean_age = sum(patient_ages) / len(patient_ages)
print(f'Mean Age: {mean_age}')
```

    Mean Age: 52.62015503875969



```python
# calculate mean with statistics package
from statistics import mean

mean_age = mean(patient_ages)
print(f'Mean Age: {mean_age}')
```

    Mean Age: 52.62015503875969


## Median


```python
# calculate median with a for loop
from math import floor

sorted_ages = sorted(patient_ages)

midpoint = len(sorted_ages) / 2

if midpoint.is_integer():
    high_index = floor(midpoint)
    low_index = high_index - 1
    median_age = (sorted_ages[high_index] + sorted_ages[low_index]) / 2
else:
    median_age = sorted_ages[floor(midpoint)]

print(f'Median Age: {median_age}')
```

    Median Age: 52



```python
# calculate median with statistics package
from statistics import median

median_age = median(patient_ages)
print(f'Median Age: {median_age}')
```

    Median Age: 52


## Variance


```python
# calculate variance with a for loop
mean_age = mean(patient_ages)
squares = []

for age in patient_ages:
    squares.append((age - mean_age)**2)
    
age_variance = mean(squares)
print(f'Variance: {age_variance}')
```

    Variance: 995.2433147046452



```python
# calculate variance with a list comprehension
mean_age = mean(patient_ages)
squares = [(age - mean_age)**2 for age in patient_ages]
age_variance = mean(squares)
print(f'Variance: {age_variance}')
```

    Variance: 995.2433147046452



```python
# calculate variance with map and reduce
from functools import reduce

mean_age = mean(patient_ages)

squares = map(lambda x: (x - mean_age) ** 2, patient_ages)
age_variance = reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, squares) / len(patient_ages)
print(f'Variance: {age_variance}')
```

    Variance: 995.2433147046452



```python
# calculate variance with statistics package
from statistics import pvariance
age_variance = pvariance(patient_ages)
print(f'Populaiton Variance: {age_variance}')
```

    Populaiton Variance: 995.2433147046452



```python
# calculate variance with statistics package
from statistics import variance
age_variance = variance(patient_ages)
print(f'Saple Variance: {age_variance}')
```

    Saple Variance: 1003.0186531007752


## Standard Deviation


```python
# calculate variance with statistics package
import math
from statistics import pvariance

age_variance = pvariance(patient_ages)
standard_devation = math.sqrt(age_variance)
print(f'Standard Deviation: {standard_devation}')
```

    Standard Deviation: 31.547477152771584



```python
# calculate variance with statistics package
from statistics import pstdev

standard_devation = pstdev(patient_ages)
print(f'Standard Deviation: {standard_devation}')

    Standard Deviation: 31.547477152771584



```python
# calculate standard deviation with statistics package
from statistics import pstdev

standard_deviation = pstdev(patient_ages)
