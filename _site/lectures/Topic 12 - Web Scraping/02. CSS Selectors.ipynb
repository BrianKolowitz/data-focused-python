    "# How CSS Selectors Work\n",
    "\n",
    "[source](https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you new to CSS? This article is for you! Perhaps the biggest key to understanding CSS is understanding selectors. Selectors are what allows you to target specific HTML elements and apply style to them. Let's not think about style right now though, let's just focus on the selecting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, the CSS would be in a file called something like style.css that is referenced from an HTML document called something like index.html. They are separate files, which is the great thing about CSS, keeping the design away from the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what that HTML file would be like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "  <title>We're learning selectors!</title>\n",
    "  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <h1 id=\"yay\">Yay</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And the CSS file would contain just the selector blocks like you'll see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CSS**\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "#happy-cake {\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTML**\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!-- WILL match -->\n",
    "<div id=\"happy-cake\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- WILL match -->\n",
    "<aside id=\"happy-cake\"></aside>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Will NOT match -->\n",
    "<div id=\"sad-cake\">Wrong ID!</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Will NOT match -->\n",
    "<div class=\"happy-cake\">That's not an ID!</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ID selectors are the most powerful type of selector in terms of [CSS specificity](https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/). Meaning that they beat out other types of selectors and the styles defined within win. That sounds good, but that's typically [considered bad](https://css-tricks.com/a-line-in-the-sand/), because it's nice to have lower-specificity selectors that are easier to override when needed."
