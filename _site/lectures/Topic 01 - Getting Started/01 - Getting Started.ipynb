    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Data Focused Python. In this guide we'll walk through all the steps you need to get started with the course. Python has a robust community which is great, but it also means there's going to be many options from python distribution to IDEs to libraries. There's no right or wrong selection, only the one that works best for you.\n",

    "\n",
    "After you're comfortable working with your Python IDE to create basic python programs, you'll want to clone the course materials from [GitHub](https://github.com/BrianKolowitz/data-focused-python). Before you can clone the repository, you'll have to install [git](https://git-scm.com/) on your local machine. [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a distributed version control system that's great for managing projects with distributed team members. There's a lot of great resources on how to use git. Here's 2 of my favorite interactive tutorials:\n",

    "Once you've installed git and are somewhat comfortable with the command line tool, you can read about how to [Clone a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) from GitHub. \n",
