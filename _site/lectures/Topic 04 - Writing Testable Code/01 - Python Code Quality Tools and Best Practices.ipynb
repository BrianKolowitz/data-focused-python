    "A quick Google search yields many results defining code quality. As it turns out, the term can mean many different things to people.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of trying to define code quality is to look at one end of the spectrum: high-quality code. Hopefully, you can agree on the following high-quality code identifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It does what it is supposed to do.\n",
    "* It does not contain defects or problems.\n",
    "* It is easy to read, maintain, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three identifiers, while simplistic, seem to be generally agreed upon. In an effort to expand these ideas further, let’s delve into why each one matters in the realm of software."

One fateful night the cat knocks over a plant, spilling dirt everywhere. When you try to use the vacuum to clean the pile of dirt, it breaks, spewing the dirt everywhere.\n",

As an added bonus, if docstrings are consistent, there are tools capable of generating documentation directly from the code.\n",

    "High-quality code does what it’s supposed to do without breaking. It is easy to read, maintain, and extend. It functions without problems or defects and is written so that it’s easy for the next person to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully it goes without saying that you should strive to have such high-quality code. Luckily, there are methods and tools to help improve code quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Style guides will bring consistency to your code. PEP8 is a great starting point for Python. Linters will help you identify problem areas and inconsistencies. You can use linters throughout the development process, even automating them to flag lint-filled code before it gets too far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having linters complain about style also avoids the need for style discussions during code reviews. Some people may find it easier to receive candid feedback from these tools instead of a team member. Additionally, some team members may not want to “nitpick” style during code reviews. Linters avoid the politics, save time, and complain about any inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, all the linters mentioned in this article have various command line options and configurations that let you tailor the tool to your liking. You can be as strict or as loose as you want, which is an important thing to realize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving code quality is a process. You can take steps towards improving it without completely disallowing all nonconformant code. Awareness is a great first step. It just takes a person, like you, to first realize how important high-quality code is."
