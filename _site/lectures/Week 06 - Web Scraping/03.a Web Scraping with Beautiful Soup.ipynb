    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data analysis, big data, and machine learning projects require scraping websites to gather the data that you’ll be working with. The Python programming language is widely used in the data science community, and therefore has an ecosystem of modules and tools that you can use in your own projects. In this tutorial we will be focusing on the Beautiful Soup module.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is a Python library that allows for quick turnaround on web scraping projects. Currently available as Beautiful Soup 4 and compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3, Beautiful Soup creates a parse tree from parsed HTML and XML documents (including documents with non-closed tags or [tag soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_soup) and other malformed markup).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will collect and parse a web page in order to grab textual data and write the information we have gathered to a CSV file."

It would also be useful to have a working familiarity with these modules.\n",

    "## Understanding the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll be working with data from the official website of the [National Gallery of Art](https://www.nga.gov/) in the United States. The National Gallery is an art museum located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It holds over 120,000 pieces dated from the Renaissance to the present day done by more than 13,000 artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to search the Index of Artists, which, at the time of updating this tutorial, is available via the [Internet Archive’s](https://archive.org/) [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) at the following URL:\n",

    "Since we’ll be doing this project in order to learn about web scraping with Beautiful Soup, we don’t need to pull too much data from the site, so let’s limit the scope of the artist data we are looking to scrape. Let’s therefore choose one letter — in our example we’ll choose the letter **Z** — and we’ll see a page that looks like this:\n",
